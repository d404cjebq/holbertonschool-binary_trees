/**
 * binary_tree_leaves - Counts the leaves in a binary tree
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to count the leaves
 *
 * Description:
 * Counts the total number of leaf nodes in a binary tree by recursively
 * traversing the left and right subtrees. A node is considered a leaf
 * if it has no left or right child. A NULL pointer is not counted
 * as a leaf. If tree is NULL, the function returns 0.
 *
 * Return:
 * The total number of leaves in the tree, or 0 if tree is NULL.
